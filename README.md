# A prediction showing the probability of customers to pay back loans using Decision Trees and Random forest

 This is a repository that contains the prediction of the probability of customers to pay back loans . The dataset used in the project is also included in the repository
# Project's description

This project is aimed at predicting a stock's closing price based on certain factors like
* credit policy
* Intrest rate
* Education
* Debt consolidation
* credit card

# Installation

In building a linear regression model to predict the closing price of Tesla's stock, i used the following libraries
* pandas
* seaborn
* matplotlib
* Numpy
* sklearn

# Project methodology

* Data wrangling
* spliting the data into train and test
* Training the model
* Testing for the accuracy of the prediction model

# Result

I got an accuracy of 75% using decision tres and 78% accuracy using Random forest
